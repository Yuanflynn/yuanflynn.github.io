{% include base_path %}

I was born and raised in Huanggang, Hubei Province. During my undergraduate studies, I spent time exploring and working across multiple cities and industries worldwide, and each stop along this journey afforded me unique perspectives into how different cultures engage with science, art, and the humanities.

With a background that fuses Economics and Computational Social Science, I draw on a rich tapestry of interdisciplinary insights to explore questions at the intersection of Economics and Geography. I love connecting ideas across domains, whether itâ€™s bridging technology and literature or finding common ground between social sciences and philosophy.

I welcome collaborations and discussions with like-minded explorers. If you share a similar passion for curiosity, feel free to reach out through email.
