Eradicating poverty and advancing affordable and clean energy are core components of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Yet many developing countries face energy shortages that hinder their economic development, making balancing these two goals for sustainable development a century-old challenge.

Using remote sensing and county-level economic data, this study evaluates China’s Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Program and identifies its dual impacts: economically, it boosts gross domestic product by 2.9% via income growth, job creation and capital inflows; environmentally, it promotes industrial clean transition and rural energy upgrading, reducing SO₂ concentrations by 4.46 μg/m³. The study further analyzes the policy’s effectiveness, mechanisms, and sustainability, offering empirical references and optimization insights for scaling such green poverty reduction models in energy-poor regions globally.
